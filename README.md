# bounties
a daily game where you complete bounties to earn points.

## design goals
in *bounties* you will engage with a system that gets more and more complex as it grows. each season (roughly two weeks) there is a user-wide election where players cast votes on new rules and behaviors. the winning mechanical change or addition is implemented for the next season. after a mechanic has been given a trial run for a season, it will either be kept or discarded, per another referendum. 

players should feel a sense of curiosity and wonder as they poke around this system and try to uncover its secrets.
